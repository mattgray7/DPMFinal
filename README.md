DPMFinal
========

Project for DPM fall 2013.

The project involves building a Lego robot and software (using Java and Lejos) such that it picks up blue blocks and brings them to a specified zone. It will need to avoid obstacles (larger wood blocks and walls) and keep track of its position (using odometry).

The actual requirements and most of the documentations is on google drive ("ECSE211 Final Project Group 7", shared folder owned by mattgray7).
